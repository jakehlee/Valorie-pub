# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how the Valorie Discord bot ("the Bot") collects, uses, and protects data when added to a Discord server or guild. By using the Bot, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Data Collection
The Bot collects minimal data required for its functionality. This includes:
- Guild or Server IDs: The unique identifier of the Discord server the Bot is added to.
- Server Configurations: Settings and preferences set by server administrators for the Bot's operation within their server.

The Bot does not collect, store, or process any personal data about individual Discord users, including but not limited to usernames, user IDs, messages, or message content.

## 2. Data Usage
The collected Guild or Server IDs and Configurations are used solely for the Bot to function as intended within the respective Discord servers. This data is necessary for the Bot to maintain server-specific settings and provide its services appropriately in each server.

## 3. Data Storage and Security
All collected data is stored securely and anonymously. The Bot developer implements industry-standard security measures to prevent unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of the stored data. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

## 4. Data Retention
The Bot retains the collected Guild or Server IDs and Configurations only for the duration that the Bot remains in the respective Discord server. Upon the Bot leaving or being removed from a server, all data associated with that specific server is automatically deleted.

## 5. Third-Party Links
The Bot may provide links to third-party websites or services. While the Bot does not collect any data regarding user interaction with these links, the linked websites may have their own independent privacy policies. The Bot developer is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such third-party sites. Users are encouraged to review the privacy policies of any linked websites they visit.

## 7. Changes to this Privacy Policy
The Bot developer reserves the right to update or change this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised Privacy Policy. Users are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates. Continued use of the Bot after the posting of changes constitutes acceptance of those changes.

By using Valorie, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use the Bot.
